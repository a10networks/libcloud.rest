    --host=HOST        Host to bind to
    --port=PORT        Port to listen on
    --log-level=LEVEL  Log level

## Examples ##
[cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) is a command line tool for transferring data with URL syntax.
It can be used to interact with the Libcloud REST API.


**Get list of images**  
You can request a image list  with this command in cURL:
```shell
curl libcloud-api:5000/0.1/compute/RACKSPACE_UK/images -H x-auth-user:user -H x-api-key:123
```
In return, you should get 200 OK response with list of images.
```json
[{"id": "31", "name": "Windows Server 2008 SP2 x86"},
 {"id": "85", "name": "Windows Server 2008 R2 x64"},
 {"id": "115", "name": "Ubuntu 11.04"},
 ...
]
```
**Create node**  
The call to create a server must use the POST method and request body must be JSON payload with node arguments.
```shell
curl -i -X POST localhost:5000/0.1/compute/RACKSPACE_UK/nodes -H x-auth-user:user -H x-api-key:123
-H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "rest_test","size_id" : "1", "image_id": "115"}'
```
Normal response would have stasus code 201 CREATED and looks like this:
```json
{"public_ips": ["0.0.0.0"],
 "state": 3,
 "id": "1",
 "name": "resttest"}
```
