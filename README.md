# libcloud.rest [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/islamgulov/libcloud.rest.png)](http://travis-ci.org/islamgulov/libcloud.rest)

REST interface for [Libcloud][1] which exposes all the Libcloud functionality
through a RESTful API. Currently Libcloud has a big limitation - you can only
use it with Python. REST interface allows users to leverage Libcloud 
functionality through an arbitrary language which knows how to talk HTTP.

Note: This is an Apache Google Summer of Code 2012 project.

## Deploying

By default Libcloud REST runs using debug WSGI server.
